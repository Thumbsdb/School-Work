\section{(P6)Present Prototype and Obtain Feedback}
*insert video of the game*
What we should expect to see in this video is that player is able to move freely and anywhere on the screen. You should also be able safe spawn in starting up the world.
The character is the player controlled ninija, this mets the rquirement "The game must have one identifiable character represented by a sprite that the user controls". This reflects the designs as we can see the in the video with the same character from our desigm documentation on the top. It was disigned so that that our target audience(young teenagers and childer)

The hud is a key comconept on the screen since it was is what the user sees all thtime


\section{(M3)Make changes to the design \& prototype based on feedback}

\subsection{analyse the results}
We have hit the requirements 
We have hit hte requirements by seeing what was outlined in the proposed document and making sure we hit the deadlines. The requiremens where clearly layed out and that made it easy.
The changes the game our client wants our is that the game shouold be more advanced movement and adding more difficult puzles for the player to 

Having more difficult playing means that game is more enganing to the player and there will hopefully be better advertising opertions.

\end{enumerate}

Gauging diffculty is hard since it verys between each player and some players might complaing about hte
