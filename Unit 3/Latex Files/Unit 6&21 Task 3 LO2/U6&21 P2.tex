\section{Company Background}
The client I have chosen for BMC IT solutions to work with is The Great UNKNOWN. The Great UNKNOWN is a company who are dedicated to exploring space and selling trips to people who looking for unique and exciting adventures. All of the staff who are employed by The Great UNKNOWN are all PhD graduates in rocket science, engineering and maths. Their combined knowledge in space travel will allow us to do more research and development which will lead to improvements in our space projects. We hope that this knowledge will lead to advancements that will bring a better brighter future for everyone.

\section{Purpose of the website}
The purpose of the website is to capture people's imagination and to make them curious about space, just like we are, and possibly one day turn them into a space scientists.

The company want to show people that there is a lot to space that we donâ€™t currently know about. Getting people on the journey into space will show them how limitless it is. To that end the website will allow customers to view and book a flight from Earth to the Moon. The booking system will allow customers to see what flights are available and how to book them. Once booked customers will be able to login back in to the website and view and amend their bookings.

\section{Type of content}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text is used in nearly every website on the internet. If you don't have any text on your website it would likely be a lackluster website. Text will convey the message the client wants to send out in the way they want to convey it.
    \item Images are used in a website in many different ways e.g. demonstration of a product, promoting a product and celebrating events. Images are very common and are widely understood by everyone because there is no language barrier. 
    \item Videos are the best way to promote a product because you can convey a lot more information which will allow a client to promote their product more effectively. The downside to videos are that it takes a lot more effort and resource to make a video and even with that there can a language barrier created.
    \item Social Media can be used to promote you website on other popular social sites. The downside to this can be that your site could be shown in a bad light on those sites, all of which is outside your control. 
\end{itemize}

\section{User Interactivity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User Interactivity is the interaction of the user and software
    \item Benefits of web user interactivity are that the website feels more reactive and not stale and unresponsive to the user 
    \item A list of interactive features we will create on our client's website:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Slideshow on homepage to show latest movie release for example 
        \item Google Map, can show the location of you store
        \item Online booking / order form 
        \item All web pages will be linked using hyperlinks
        \item Scroll and the images in the background lag behind
        \item Some images will respond to the cursor movement this could be a glow or the text getting bigger.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Responsive design requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Responsive website design means that the website is flexible and can fit on a mobile or desktop device.
    \item The benefits of that are that any device can be used to see and use your website
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For The Great UNKNOWN we will be using CSS for our responsive design because CSS is supported on nearly every web device and it can be setup to respond dynamically to different screen layouts
        \item CSS media queries are statements that they define different style rules for different devices
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Constraints and Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item A deadline of late December 2023 is a hard constraint meaning we need to have a working website designed, developed and tested before that date.
\item We will need to train company staff on how to look after the website.
\item The CSS / JavaScript must not be too large or take up a lot of processing power as the website must operate on low powered mobile devices.
\item We will need to make sure that customers can navigate the site easily.
\item Website development will require our developers to have skills in HTML5,CSS3 and JavaScript
\item The required design of the website must conform to the requirements set out by the customer
\item The client has required the use of PHP and MySQL
\item Scope of solution - our site does not make the booking, that us up to a back end booking system to do, on our command.
\end{itemize}
