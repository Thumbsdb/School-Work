\section{The Problem Statement}
We are here to solve the problem in health care of patients being unable to get support for their needs quickly and efficiently.

\section{The Proposed Solution}
The plan to solve this problem is going to use cognitive computing to have smart chatbots. Using chatbots will make it more easier for our end users to help them to identify their problems and hopefully be able to hand them off to a actual doctor. By doing this it will speed up the process of diagnosing our patient hopefully leading them to have a better life. We may also be able to hand off some receptionist tasks such as making bookings, querying prescriptions and ordering repeat prescriptions.

\section{Risk}
A risk in doing this are that the bot might misdiagnose our patients since it is a robot talking to them so that is why we have them talking to a doctor at the end of the talk with them. There could be a loss of jobs since our new system will be replacing their jobs but we see this a good since it will allow staff to be retrained in to more specialised jobs. 
There is a potential for social and maybe ethical issues since being diagnosed by a robot is a soulless and could make the customers feel uncomfortable. To help with these concerns we have the option to not talk to the chatbot.
If the chatbot is allowed to take actions on behalf of a patient then there is a risk of security as we have no way to authenticate a user over a telephone. To mitigate this only actions with no consequences are allowed to be made by the bot.

\section{The Timeline}
The timeline of the project
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Proposed start
	\item Precedence table
	\item Milestones
	\item Estimated finish date
	\item Date of acceptance 
	\item Gantt chart
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The proposed start}
The proposed start will be on the 10th May 2024. What we plan to do when we begin we will be to start making our initial design mock ups for cognitive computer support.
We will need to drawup client requirements in close collaboration with the client. This is important as there are issues around acceptance by clients, and clients with specific needs that we assume the chatbot will need to make adaptations for and only GP and registrar will know what these are.
The design documentation will be made to show the positive and negatives of what having cognitive computing bots can bring to healthcare.

\subsection{Milestones}
The Milestone for our project will be 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Making the chatbot talk to the user
		\item Get the chatbot to diagnose the user
		\item Get the chatbot to work over the phone
		\item Make sure all these systems works together
		\item Public release
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Estimated finish date}

The finish dates is 10th May 2025. We expect everything to be delivered and ready by that time so that our clients have a product available 

\subsection{Date of acceptance}
The date of acceptance will 5th may 2025.

\section{Costs}
The cost for the project is going to high since it a large Cognitive computing task. We expect this task to cast Â£2,250,000. \\
The reason this is so expensive is due to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Material to Teach the AI
	\item Teaching The AI
	\item Research 
\end{enumerate}
The cost for this going to high since this is a large since this a cognitive computing bot which will have to run on either high end computers or on the cloud, which can be expensive. There may also be a requirement from the client that the chatbot learns from patients, and this is a very costly process.

\section{The Acceptance}
Acceptance of our project will be hard since replacing humans is hard job but the improvement to the everyone's health and the extra efficiency will be very persuasive. There will be a \textbf{Project Completion Form} for the project which will rubber stamp agreement.
