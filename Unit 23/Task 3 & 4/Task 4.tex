\section{The Problem Statement}
we are here to solved the problem in health care of patients being unable to get support for their needs quickly and efficiently.

\section{The Proposed Solution}
The plan to solve this problem is going to use cognitive computing to have smart chatbots. Using chatbots will make it more easier for our end users to help them to identify their problems and hopefully be able to hand them off to a actual doctor. By doing this it will speed up the process of diagnosing our patiend hopefully leading them to have a better life.

\section{Risk}
The risk in doing this are that might misdiagnose our patients since it is a robot talking to them so that is why we have them talking to a doctor at the end of the talk with them. There could be a lost of jobs since our new system will be replacing their jobs but we see this a good since it will   . 
There is a potential for social and maybe ethical issues since being diagnosed by a robot is a soulless and could make the customers feel to help with these concerns we have the

\subsection{The proposed start}
The proposed start will be on the 10th may 2024. What we plan to do when we begin we will start making our initial design mock ups for cognitive computer support air
The design documentation will be made to show the positive and negatives of what having cognitive

\subsection{Milestones}
The Milestone for our project will be 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Making the chatbot talk to the user
		\item Get the chatbot to diagnose the user
		\item Get the chatbot to work over the phone
		\item Make sure all these systems works together
		\item Public release
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Estimated finish date}

The finish dates is 10th May 2025. We expect everything to be delivered and ready by that time so that our clients have a product available 

\subsection{Date of acceptance}
The date of acceptance will 5th may 2025.

\section{Costs}
The cost for the project is going to high since it a large Cognitive computing task. We expect this task to cast Â£2,250,000. \\
The reason this is so expensive is due to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Material to Teach the AI
	\item Teaching The AI
	\item Research 
\end{enumerate}
The cost for this going to high since this is a large since this a cognitive computing 
Cost loads of money

\section{The Acceptance}
Acceptance of our project will be hard since replacing humans is hard job but the improvement to the health. The increase to health and efficiency. There will be a \textbf{Project Completion Form} for the project Cognitive computer support aid for healthcare
