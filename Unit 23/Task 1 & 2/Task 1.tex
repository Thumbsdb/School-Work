\maketitle

You are required to investigate opportunities for the positive application of cognitive computing.
Investigating cognitive computing opportunities i.e.

\section{purpose}
The purpose of the cognitive computing is to advance human life and make everything better. 
The purpose of cognitive computers are designed to solve the types of that humans that typically make for people
The main purpose of cognitive computing is to develop computer systems that are capable of tackling complex problems that usually require human cognition. This involves advanced techniques like machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision and more


\section{how will it achieve its purpose}

\section{how would cognitive computing help}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item rapidly innovate
    \item make more money with improved insights 
    \item gain a competitive edge
\end{enumerate}



The evidence for this should be presented as a written report.
This work must be in your own words & provide a comprehensive summary of your findings.

\section{What is cognitive computing}
Cognitive computing refers to technology platforms influenced by cognitive science to simulate the human thought process and encompass artificial intelligence and signal processing. This may include capabilities like machine learning, reasoning, natural language processing(NLP), speech and vision recognition, human-computer interaction(HCI) and MORE.
