\section{purpose}
The primary goal of cognitive computing is to create computer systems capable of solving complex problems typically requiring human cognition. This entails using advanced techniques such as machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, and others.

Cognitive computing solutions differ from traditional programmed systems in their ability to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data from various sources and uncover patterns and insights. They can interpret text, images, and speech, making connections across different data types. Over time, they continuously learn from interactions and experiences.

This capacity to emulate the natural learning process makes cognitive computing ideal for fields like healthcare, finance, and customer service, where large volumes of complex data need to be analyzed to find solutions.

\section{how will it achieve its purpose}
To achieve the the purpose of cognitive computing systems must have the following attributes:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Adaptive. Systems must be flexible enough to learn as information changes and goals evolve. They must digest dynamic data in real time and adjust as the data and environments change.
	\item Interactive. Human-computer interaction is a critical component in cognitive systems. Users must be able to interact with cognitive machines and define their needs as they change. The technologies must also be able to interact with other processors, devices and cloud platforms.
	\item Iterative and stateful. Cognitive computing technologies can ask questions and pull in additional data to identify or clarify a problem. They must be stateful in that they keep information about similar situations that have occurred previously.
	\item Contextual. Understanding context is critical in thought processes. Cognitive systems must understand, identify and mine contextual data, such as syntax, time, location, domain, user requirements, user profiles, tasks and goals. The systems can draw on multiple sources of information, including structured and unstructured data and visual, auditory and sensor data.
\end{enumerate}

\section{how would cognitive computing help}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Talking with more customers 
	\item More accurate data  analysis
	\item Leaner and more efficient business process
	\item Improved customer interaction
	\item Increased employee productivity
\end{enumerate}
